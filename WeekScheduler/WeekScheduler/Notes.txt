TODO:

what to do what to do?

optimizations?
	better algorithm? - create objects that binds together logical parts - fx activity and tag
	less computation when viewing data - week lists, especially in work time view!

less context lookups?
	remove _context from repository code to enable unit testing

create unit tests

create integration tests
	get connection to the same DB

create a week view like the "vagtplan"
	colors DONE
	TODO:
	add partial view
	add table grid
	populate with data from employee week slot activity ect. all that _week uses....
	add color to grid - format - beautify the grid to match "vagtplan"

add tagging, create a list of tags instead of naming stuff correctly
	tags should be asociated with Activities and nothing else
	TODO: add to algorithm
